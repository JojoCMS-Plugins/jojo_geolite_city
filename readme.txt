A Jojo implementation of Maxmind's free IP -> Country/City database. The free version is supposedly slightly less accurate than the paid version. This code should work with the paid version - simply replace the free .dat file with the paid .dat file.

This product includes GeoLite data created by MaxMind, available from http://www.maxmind.com/

This plugin does 2 things only - Firstly it provides new functions for getting Country / Region / City information. You will need to use these functions in your custom code to do whatever you need.
The other small change this plugin makes is auto-populating the billing / shipping country in the shopping cart based on the Geo-IP detected country (assuming you have the jojo_cart plugins installed).

Usage is simple:

Install the plugin, then...

$countrycode = Jojo_Plugin_jojo_geolite_country::getCountryCode();
$countryname = Jojo_Plugin_jojo_geolite_country::getCountryName();

By default, the lookup is done on the browser's current IP address. To use a specific IP address, supply this as an argument...

$countrycode = Jojo_Plugin_jojo_geolite_country::getCountryCode('11.22.33.44');
$countryname = Jojo_Plugin_jojo_geolite_country::getCountryName('11.22.33.44');

It is reommended you check for updates every so often at http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecountry - replace the .dat file with the updated version.
